## Simple Tariff Calculator
This is a Python 2 program which I have created in 2015 to calculate total cost using energy tariff in a power distribution company in Bangladesh.

## Motivation
Back 2015 I was working in Prepayment Metering Project of DPDC (a power distribution company of Bangladesh). I wanted to implement my knowledge of Python. So I wrote this program and use it when I needed to calculate total money in TK (currency in Bangladesh). The tariff rate may be obsolete now. It can be updated to latest version.
