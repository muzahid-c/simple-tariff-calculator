# Simple Tariff Calculator
This is a Python 2 program which I have created back in 2015. Back then I was working in Prepayment Metering Project of DPDC (a power distribution company of Bangladesh). I wanted to implement my knowledge of Python. So I wrote this program and use it when I needed to calculate total money. The tariff rate may be obsolete now. It can be updated to latest version. I had used py2exe to convert it to exe (which is not included in this repository) so that I don't need python installed to use it.
