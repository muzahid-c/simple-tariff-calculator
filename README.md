## Simple Tariff Calculator
This is a Python 2 program which I have created in 2015 to calculate total cost using energy tariff in a power distribution company in Bangladesh.

## Motivation
Back in 2015 I was working in Prepayment Metering Project of DPDC (a power distribution company of Bangladesh). I wanted to implement my knowledge of Python. So I wrote this program and used it when I needed to calculate total money in TK (currency in Bangladesh). The tariff rate may be obsolete now. By updating the tariff it can be used now.

## Tech/framework used

- [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org) Previously used which created a bunch of files, not a single exe
